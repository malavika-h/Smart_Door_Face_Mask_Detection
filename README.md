# Smart_Door_Face_Mask_Detection
Developed a smart door system which can carry out artificial intelligence-based face mask detection, automated temperature screening, door opening and hand sanitizer dispensing. Further, data collected from the people at the door is sent to a cloud network which can later be used to study the trends in rising or coming down of cases and average temperatures of people in a region

FaceMaskDetectionModel folder contains the code needed to train the model as well as the final trained model
RPi_Code folder contains the code required to run the trined model and interact with the other sensors using the RPi
